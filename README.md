# Robotics_project_2R_robot-arm

## scripts directory:

- it has kinematics scripts (inverse and forward) and trajectory script
- trajectory scripts are two (hardware and software)... As hardware: we used open loop control algorithm
                                                    ... AS software: we test the performance of closed loop control on simulation
                                                    
## Arduino code attached here too in arduino_code_hardware directory.


## graph_results_images directory has all the simulation images in both cases (open and closed loop control).
